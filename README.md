## Design

### Colours

The choice of a dark background for the website draws inspiration from the allure of a luxurious jewelry box's dark material. This carefully selected color scheme serves to elevate the visual presentation of the website's content, especially the high-quality images of exquisite dishes and captivating ambiances. By embracing the dark backdrop, the website aims to create a sense of opulence and sophistication, mirroring the lavishness associated with the Caribbean Cove's culinary offerings
